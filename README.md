"Yet Another Image Viewer"

A FLTK-based image viewer, intended to (eventually) replace feh but with additional capabilities.

Very much a work-in-progress, mostly a platform for experimentation.

Pulls together [GIF animation](https://github.com/wcout/fltk-gif-animation) from wcout, [improved FLTK rotation/scaling](https://github.com/rageworx/fl_imgtk) from rageworx, Webp and animated webp.
